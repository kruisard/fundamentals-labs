The second demonstrates the development of ellipses in phase space for the same FODO structure. The third demonstrates a local orbit distortion in a FODO lattice and how to correct it. \n",

    "For transverse motion of a particle (beam) to be stable, the trace of the 2X2 transport matrix for each degree of freedom (horizontal and vertical) must be less than or equal to 2 in absolute value: |TrM| ≤2. For a simple FODO structure made up of focusing elements (of focal lengths ±F separated by a distance L) the condition is that F ≥L/2. \n",

    "Today’s final exercise will be to look at how we can correct for a local orbit distortion. In this FODO lattice, F = 20 meters, L  = 25 and at specific locations in the structure (initially position ‘10’), there is an additional element –a steering magnet –which gives the particle an angular deflection of amount $\\theta$ each time the particle passes by. By looking at the plot of particle displacement, we see that when the particle starts with x = 0 and x’ = 0, it begins a betatron oscillation when it passes by the steering magnet (see the SOLID trace in the plot).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a particular orbit which, if the particle trajectory starts out just right, the orbit will be deflected by the steering magnet but when it returns to the beginning of the accelerator will end up with the same position and slope it started out with. Thus, this particular particle will follow the same path over and over again. \n",

    "- Notice how the particle appears to oscillate about the new closed orbit generated by the steering magnet. \n",

    "Even though the magnet only steers the particle at one location in the accelerator, it can affect the displacement everywhere. If F and L are in meters, x in millimeters, and x’ in mrad, then $\\theta$ is in mrad (0.05 initially)."
